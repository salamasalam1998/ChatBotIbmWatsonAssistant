# ChatBotIbmWatsonAssistant
This is the 3rd task of IOT training part at SmartMethods.
The main idea of this task is to create a chatbot.
Students should use IBM Watson Assistant.
Watson Assistant provides customers with fast, consistent, and accurate answers in any application, device, or channel. 
Using artificial intelligence, Watson Assistant learns from conversations with customers, improving its ability to solve problems the first time.
it is also able to remove the frustration of long wait times, tedious searches, and useless chatbots.
I provide the bot (the robot) with useful information related to the smart methods company and its acheivments as well as training information , website of the company in addition to some general question.
I faced problems when trying to make the bot in arabic , I were facing error. However , I asked the trainers and they advice me to choose "Dallas" , after that I make the bot in English.
It was a good experience to learn about the chatbot which is a part of AI.
I would like to thank Mr/Asem and Miss/ Asmaa regarding their efforts and their existence every time we need a help !
